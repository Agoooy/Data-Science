<h1>Data Science Introduction</h1>
</p>

This repository contains a Data Science projects completed by me for hobby purposes. The projects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown files, showacasing various techniques and analyses.
<br/>
<br/>*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*
